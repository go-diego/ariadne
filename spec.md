# Problem

BriteCore's clients use our platform to manage all aspects of their business, including tracking open claims, sending out monthly bills and running annual reports.

As a result, many of our pages are data heavy, and we often use a data table component for display and modifying this information. A data table component is similar to a classic HTML table, but includes other features.

A component to display this data should include the following functionality:

-   Displaying data in sortable columns
-   Filtering data based on different parameters
-   Searching data
-   Actions that can be taken on each data item, or applied to all items in the table.
-   Effective display and user experience across resolutions

# Coding Test

We would like you to create you own data table component. For this test, download the [data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eBsATYdeISUGjdBr0SzNhY5Ur9mkl0u11tfhxn2Y1WE/edit?usp=sharing) in CSV format to your own computer. This is mock payment data for one of our products. This data includes a description field, which the user will need to be able to customize.

# User Stories

-   As a payment supervisor, I would like to be able to view recent payments logged in the system, so that I can understand all the transactions that have been made.

-   As a payment supervisor, I would like to be able to edit the descriptions of recent payments easily, so that others can clearly understand why a payment was made.

# Requirements

Take as much or as little time as you would like to complete the following requirements:

-   Satisfy the user stories outlined above.
-   Include tests for your component.
-   Feel free to use any frontend framework you'd like. Your solution can also leverage different plugins/tools, but the data table component you create should be your own, and not one provided by a UI pattern library.
-   **Bonus Points!**: Use of Vuejs.
-   **Bonus Points!**: As you'll be working alongside a design team regularly, an attention to visual polish and UX would be great to see.

# Deliverables

One of the major goals in this project is to see how you fill in ambiguities in your own creative way. There is no such thing as a perfect project here, just interpretations of the instructions above, so be creative in your approach.

In order to move your application forward, deliverables will include:

-   A deployed version of your project

-   A GitHub repo containing your project. Your repo must contain these three things:
    -   A README that explains your approach and deployment method
    -   Your code solution to this test
    -   The Javascript file called quiz.js that contains what you used to solve the debugging quiz
        A JSON file called description.json that describes you.
-   Adding of these items to your resume's cover letter:
    -   The link to the GitHub repo that lists this project
    -   The link to the deployed version of your project
-   Uploading of your resume with cover letter in PDF or DOCX format by [clicking this link](https://hire.withgoogle.com/public/jobs/britecorecom/view/P_AAAAAAEAADyA3tktMd8cuW)

### Follow-up Questions

Bonus points if your README answers these questions:

-   How long did you spend on the test? Would you do anything differently if you had more time?
-   In what ways would you adapt your component so that it could be used in many different scenarios where a data table is required?
-   What is one CSS property that you recently learned about that helped you solve a problem?
